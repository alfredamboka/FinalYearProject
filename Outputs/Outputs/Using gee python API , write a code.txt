Using gee python API , write a code that perform the following; a)   Obtain landsat 8, sentinel 2 and MODIS image collection between 2018-01-01 to 2022-12-31. b) Filter each collection to ensure that no gap, cloud exist. Resample landsat images, and MODIS images to 10m resolution. c) Ensure that all the  images are within same coordinate system.  d) On MODIS  select NDV band, clip to region of interest already defined as study_area and export to drive folder named ProjectOutputs2. e) Check all the image dates where the resampled modis , resampled landsat and sentinel do not overlap each other and ensure every date from all the collections merged only have one image. Meaning per year 366 images in collection is required. f) On the new collection, which is fused images, ensure to have the following bands ( 'B2', 'B3', 'B4', 'B8', 'B11 (SWIR 1) ', B12(SWIR 2) , 'NDVI', 'VHI', 'SMCI', 'EVI', 'GNDVI', 'SAVI', 'SR', 'EDI', 'TCI'). From the new collection, select NDVI band, and export to drive remember to clip with study_area.
